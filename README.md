<h1 align="center">DevJam Project: Predict My Career</h1>


## Introduction:
### Inspiration
   A lot of students face the difficulty of choosing  options for their careers. CS students, in particular might need to choose a subfield to prepare accordingly. Recruiters, on the other hand also need to make a decision, about assigning the best suited job-role to a candidate, while recruiting. Moreover, recruiters might also need to find the particular fit for the various job roles. 
### Solution
   'Predict my career', a web application based on  Machine Learning Algorithms. Job role predictions based on inputs from the user about their areas of interest, coding skills, company choice, and other such things.   
Students can signup as Users to:  
                   1. Fill up the form and find out the top 3 best suited job-roles for them.  
                   2. Upload the resume and save the options, they are interested in, from the predicted roles.  
Recruiters can signup as Admin to:  
                  1. Find the best suited job role for any candidate, already hired.  
                  2. Find the candidates for a particular job role(those who saved that role for themselves) and view their resumes.
